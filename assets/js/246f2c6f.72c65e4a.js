A client matches to lenders on the Capitalise Platform\\n2. Client completes required fields for a lender\'s API\\n3. Capitalise API dispatches application to Webhook\\n4. Lender processes application and responds with an offer or rejection\\n5. Client accepts or rejects offer\\n6. Capitalise redirects user to lender onboarding to finalize\\n\\nA more detailed version of this flow is displayed below:\\n\\n![API Application Flow](/img/API%20Application%20Flow.png)\\n\\n## Prerequisites & Requirements\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Required Fields\\n\\nLenders need to provide us the list of required fields (optionally with rules for requirements, e.g. only if field a > 100)\\n\\nSome sample required field rules:\\n\\n- Simply requiring a field to be complete\\n  - `Sector`\\n- A field is required based on the value of another field\\n  - `Contact Number` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader`\\n- More complex field requirements based on values and multiple conditions\\n  - `Personal Guarantees` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader` and `Revenue < \xa3100,000` and `Sector in (IT Services, Business Services)`\\n\\n---\\n\\n### API Setup\\n\\nLender needs to provide Capitalise a webhook for sending applications to. You can optionally provide a separate webhook for sending updates too, or use one for all.\\n\\n> Capitalise has an iPaaS platform which allows us to connect internal software without an API, or existing lender APIs with our API without the need for the lender to provide a webhook, if they provide endpoints to send an application to. This path is suitable for lenders we have an existing high-volume relationship with. Please speak to our product team about this integration path.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\nAuthentication uses oAuth via our Auth0 provider. We will provide you a client secret and credentials.\\n\\nTo authenticate, call our oAuth provider, `https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token`, as per the sample below:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"audience\\": \\"https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/\\",\\n  \\"client_id\\": \\"your_client_id\\",\\n  \\"client_secret\\": \\"your_client_secret\\",\\n  \\"grant_type\\": \\"password\\",\\n  \\"password\\": \\"your_password\\",\\n  \\"scope\\": \\"openid email profile\\",\\n  \\"username\\": \\"your_username\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEnsure you also send a header:\\n\\n```json\\n\\"content-type\\": \\"application/json\\"\\n```\\n\\nYou will receive a payload back like the following, use the id_token as the bearer token in all authenticated requests. These tokens usually expire within 2 minutes, so we recommend authenticating before each request, rather than storing and refreshing the token.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"access_token\\": \\"....\\",\\n  \\"id_token\\": \\"....\\",\\n  \\"scope\\": \\"openid email profile ....\\",\\n  \\"expires_in\\": 120,\\n  \\"token_type\\": \\"Bearer\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n----\\n\\n### API\\n\\nUse your Bearer token to access the API at the below URL:\\n\\n`https://capitalise.com/api/platform/v1/funding`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Go-live sign-off\\n\\nIn order to obtain production keys and configuration, you will need to demonstrate several standard scenarios:\\n\\n<strong>Minimum application</strong>\\n\\nEnsure that your API is able to deal with only the minimum mandatory fields being entered. Any additional mandatory fields required should be discussed, as lender specific requirements on existing fields can be custom configured.\\n\\n<strong>Outright rejection</strong>\\n\\nIf for any reason you will fully reject an application, e.g. due to poor credit or similar scenarios, you must demonstrate the response you give to the user is clear.\\n\\n<strong>Failed validation</strong>\\n\\nFor validation issues where the user may correct the input, you should demonstrate the error message is clear and actionable to the user. Examples of post validation here could include address verification, director lookup verification etc\\n\\n<strong>Manual Review</strong>\\n\\nIf you will direct applications for manual review, you should show that acknowledgement made along with a clear message indicating a timeline for update.\\n\\n<strong>Indicative/Underwritten Offer</strong>\\n\\nYou should demonstrate that a full and complete offer is returned to the end user if implementing offer responses.\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Schema\\n\\n## Funding Application\\n\\nIt contains:\\n\\n- apiProvider: *Lender can use this to verify the request is genuine*\\n- application: *The packaged Capitalise Application*\\n  - fundingSearch: *Key details about the users search requirements*\\n  - fundingMatch: *Key details about the lenders product the client has matched with*\\n  - profile: *The clients application form*\\n    - accountantDetails: *The clients accountant, if any.*\\n    - assetsToFinance: *(Optional) Assets the client is looking to obtain finance for*\\n    - basicCompanyDetails: *Details about the company and the primary contact for the client*\\n    - companyCredit: (Optional) *Unverified details of the companies credit standing*\\n    - directorOrSecretaryDetails: *Detail and credit information about each director, owner or secretary involved in the application*\\n    - eposTerminalInfo: *(Optional) Details of the clients primary EPOS and monthly takings*\\n    - guarantorAssetsForSecurity: *(Optional) Any assets the applicants are providing as security*\\n    - invoiceFinancing: *(Optional) Summary details of the clients outstanding invoice debtors and value*\\n    - tradeFinanceProfile: *(Optional) Summary details of the clients outstanding trade debtors and value*\\n    - tradeHistory: *Annualised revenue, asset and profit figures of the companies history*\\n    - attachments: *A list of documents attached to this application*\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"apiProvider\\": {\\n    \\"url\\": \\"https://webhook-url/\\",\\n    \\"updateUrl\\": \\"https://webhook-url/\\",\\n    \\"authorizationToken\\": \\"1234a\\"\\n  },\\n  \\"application\\": {\\n    \\"id\\": 10000,\\n    \\"reference\\": \\"Q43RT7\\",\\n    \\"status\\": \\"In Review\\",\\n    \\"responseReason\\": null,\\n    \\"comment\\": null,\\n    \\"fundingSearch\\": {\\n      \\"id\\": 10001,\\n      \\"status\\": 2,\\n      \\"amount\\": \\"15000.00\\",\\n      \\"period\\": 12,\\n      \\"statusLabel\\": \\"Reviewing\\",\\n      \\"author\\": {\\n        \\"id\\": 10002,\\n        \\"entity\\": {\\n          \\"id\\": 10003,\\n          \\"entityId\\": 10004,\\n          \\"companyName\\": \\"Acme Introducer\\"\\n        },\\n        \\"userType\\": \\"business\\",\\n        \\"name\\": \\"John Smith\\",\\n        \\"email\\": \\"johnsmith@email.com\\"\\n      },\\n      \\"manager\\": {\\n        \\"id\\": 10005,\\n        \\"entity\\": {\\n          \\"id\\": 10006,\\n          \\"entityId\\": 10007,\\n          \\"companyName\\": \\"Acme Introducer\\"\\n        },\\n        \\"userType\\": \\"business\\",\\n        \\"name\\": \\"John Smith\\",\\n        \\"email\\": \\"johnsmith@email.com\\"\\n      },\\n      \\"useOfFunds\\": \\"Business expansion\\",\\n      \\"urgency\\": \\"ASAP\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"fundingMatch\\": {\\n      \\"id\\": 10008,\\n      \\"offerId\\": null,\\n      \\"products\\": [\\n        1\\n      ],\\n      \\"productNames\\": [\\n        \\"Term Loans\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\"statusReason\\": null,\\n      \\"statusComment\\": null,\\n      \\"canUseInstantOffer\\": true,\\n      \\"canUseInstantApplication\\": true,\\n      \\"lender\\": {\\n        \\"id\\": 10009,\\n        \\"entityId\\": 10010,\\n        \\"companyName\\": \\"Lender Name\\",\\n        \\"logo\\": \\"https://logo-url\\",\\n        \\"icon\\": \\"https://icon-url\\"\\n      },\\n      \\"status\\": 1\\n    },\\n    \\"profile\\": {\\n      \\"accountantDetails\\": { #

A client matches to lenders on the Capitalise Platform\\n2. Client completes required fields for a lender\'s API\\n3. Capitalise API dispatches application to Webhook\\n4. Lender processes application and responds with an offer or rejection\\n5. Client accepts or rejects offer\\n6. Capitalise redirects user to lender onboarding to finalize\\n\\nA more detailed version of this flow is displayed below:\\n\\n![API Application Flow](/img/API%20Application%20Flow.png)\\n\\n## Prerequisites & Requirements\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Required Fields\\n\\nLenders need to provide us the list of required fields (optionally with rules for requirements, e.g. only if field a > 100)\\n\\nSome sample required field rules:\\n\\n- Simply requiring a field to be complete\\n  - `Sector`\\n- A field is required based on the value of another field\\n  - `Contact Number` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader`\\n- More complex field requirements based on values and multiple conditions\\n  - `Personal Guarantees` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader` and `Revenue < \xa3100,000` and `Sector in (IT Services, Business Services)`\\n\\n---\\n\\n### API Setup\\n\\nLender needs to provide Capitalise a webhook for sending applications to. You can optionally provide a separate webhook for sending updates too, or use one for all.\\n\\n> Capitalise has an iPaaS platform which allows us to connect internal software without an API, or existing lender APIs with our API without the need for the lender to provide a webhook, if they provide endpoints to send an application to. This path is suitable for lenders we have an existing high-volume relationship with. Please speak to our product team about this integration path.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Authentication\\n\\nAuthentication uses oAuth via our Auth0 provider. We will provide you a client secret and credentials.\\n\\nTo authenticate, call our oAuth provider, `https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token`, as per the sample below:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"audience\\": \\"https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/\\",\\n  \\"client_id\\": \\"your_client_id\\",\\n  \\"client_secret\\": \\"your_client_secret\\",\\n  \\"grant_type\\": \\"password\\",\\n  \\"password\\": \\"your_password\\",\\n  \\"scope\\": \\"openid email profile\\",\\n  \\"username\\": \\"your_username\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEnsure you also send a header:\\n\\n```json\\n\\"content-type\\": \\"application/json\\"\\n```\\n\\nYou will receive a payload back like the following, use the id_token as the bearer token in all authenticated requests. These tokens usually expire within 2 minutes, so we recommend authenticating before each request, rather than storing and refreshing the token.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"access_token\\": \\"....\\",\\n  \\"id_token\\": \\"....\\",\\n  \\"scope\\": \\"openid email profile ....\\",\\n  \\"expires_in\\": 120,\\n  \\"token_type\\": \\"Bearer\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n----\\n\\n### API\\n\\nUse your Bearer token to access the API at the below URL:\\n\\n`https://capitalise.com/api/platform/v1/funding`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Go-live sign-off\\n\\nIn order to obtain production keys and configuration, you will need to demonstrate several standard scenarios:\\n\\n<strong>Minimum application</strong>\\n\\nEnsure that your API is able to deal with only the minimum mandatory fields being entered. Any additional mandatory fields required should be discussed, as lender specific requirements on existing fields can be custom configured.\\n\\n<strong>Outright rejection</strong>\\n\\nIf for any reason you will fully reject an application, e.g. due to poor credit or similar scenarios, you must demonstrate the response you give to the user is clear.\\n\\n<strong>Failed validation</strong>\\n\\nFor validation issues where the user may correct the input, you should demonstrate the error message is clear and actionable to the user.
