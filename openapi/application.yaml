    # Introduction

    This API provides a way for lenders to receive applications from clients on the Capitalise Platform and to return offers or rejections.
    The API also supports retrieval of documentation, and a set of web hooks to receive updates for applications when the user accepts or rejects an offer.
   
     ## Application Flow

    A typical integration would follow the following flow, typically:

      1. A client matches to lenders on the Capitalise Platform

      2. Client completes required fields for a lenders API

      3. Capitalise API dispatches application to Webhook

      4. Lender processes application and responds with an offer or rejection

      5. Client accepts or rejects offer

      6. Capitalise redirect user to lender onboarding to finalise

      A more detailed version of this flow is displayed below:

    ## Prerequisites & Requirements

     ### Required Fields

     Lenders need to provide us the list of required fields (optionally with rules for requirements, e.g. only if field a > 100)

    Some sample required fields rules: 

     - Simply requiring a field to be complete 
       - Sector
     - A field is required based on the value of another field
       - Contact Number required if Company Type = Sole Trader
     - More complex field requirements based on values and multiple conditions
       - Personal Guarantees required if Company Type = Sole Trader and Revenue < Â£100,000 and Sector in (IT Services, Business Services) 

     ### API Setup

      Lender needs to provide Capitalise a webhook for sending applications to. You can optionally provide a separate webhook for sending updates too, or use one for all.
