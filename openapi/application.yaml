    # Introduction

    This API provides a way for lenders to receive applications from clients on the Capitalise Platform and to return offers or rejections.
    The API also supports retrieval of documentation, and a set of web hooks to receive updates for applications when the user accepts or rejects an offer.

     ## Application Flow

    ---

    A typical integration would follow the following flow, typically:

      1. A client matches to lenders on the Capitalise Platform
      2. Client completes required fields for a lender's API
      3. Capitalise API dispatches application to Webhook
      4. Lender processes application and responds with an offer or rejection
      5. Client accepts or rejects offer
      6. Capitalise redirects user to lender onboarding to finalize

      A more detailed version of this flow is displayed below:

    ## Prerequisites & Requirements

    ---

     ### Required Fields

     Lenders need to provide us the list of required fields (optionally with rules for requirements, e.g. only if field a > 100)

    Some sample required field rules: 

     - Simply requiring a field to be complete 
       - `Sector`
     - A field is required based on the value of another field
       - `Contact Number` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader`
     - More complex field requirements based on values and multiple conditions
       - `Personal Guarantees` required if `Company Type = Sole Trader` and `Revenue < Â£100,000` and `Sector in (IT Services, Business Services)` 

    ---

      ### API Setup

      Lender needs to provide Capitalise a webhook for sending applications to. You can optionally provide a separate webhook for sending updates too, or use one for all.

    > Capitalise has an iPaaS platform which allows us to connect internal software without an API, or existing lender APIs with our API without the need for the lender to provide a webhook, if they provide endpoints to send an application to. This path is suitable for lenders we have an existing high-volume relationship with. Please speak to our product team about this integration path.

    --- 

      ### Authentication

      Authentication uses oAuth via our Auth0 provider. We will provide you a client secret and credentials.
      To authenticate, call our oAuth provider as per the sample below:

      https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token

      ```json
      "audience": "https://capitalise.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/",
      "client_id": "your_client_id",
      "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
      "grant_type": "password",
      "password": "your_password",
      "scope": "openid email profile",
      "username": "your_username"
      ```

      Ensure you also send a header:

      ```json
      "content-type": "application/json"
      ```

      You will receive a payload back like the following, use the id_token as the bearer token in all authenticated requests. These tokens usually expire within 2 minutes, so we recommend authenticating before each request, rather than storing and refreshing the token.

      ```json
      "access_token": "....",
      "id_token": "....",
      "scope": "openid email profile ....",
      "expires_in": 120,
      "token_type": "Bearer"
      ```

    ----

      ### API

    Use your Bearer token to access the API at the below URL

    https://capitalise.com/api/platform/v1/funding

    ---

     ## Go-live sign-off

        In order to obtain production keys and configuration, you will need to demonstrate several standard scenarios:

    <strong>Minimum application</strong>

    Ensure that your API is able to deal with only the minimum mandatory fields being entered. Any additional mandatory fields required should be discussed, as lender specific requirements on existing fields can be custom configured.

    <strong>Outright rejection</strong>
    If for any reason you will fully reject an application, e.g. due to poor credit or similar scenarios, you must demonstrate the response you give to the user is clear.

    <strong>Failed validation</strong>

    For validation issues where the user may correct the input, you should demonstrate the error message is clear and actionable to the user. Examples of post validation here could include address verification, director lookup verification etc

    <strong>Manual Review</strong>

    If you will direct applications for manual review, you show show that acknowledgement made along with a clear message indicating a timeline for update.

    <strong>Indicative/Underwritten Offer</strong>

    You should demonstrate that a full and complete offer is returned to the end user if implementing offer responses.

     # Webhooks

      ## New Application Webhook

    `Webhook` When a user submits an application, a payload with a Funding Application is sent to the lender's provided webhook URL. You must return an HTTP 204 to this dispatcher, otherwise the dispatcher will attempt to resend the application at exponential intervals.

      ## Application Updated Webhook

    `Webhook` When a user marks an offer as accepted or rejected, an updated payload with a Funding Application is sent to the lender's provided webhook URL. You should filter updates sent to this webhook and only use what you need (e.g., Status is Client Accepted or Client Declined) to avoid confusion. 
    > We recommend using separate endpoints for New Applications and Application Updated. Our Updated endpoint will provide updates for all status changes. 

    You must return an HTTP 204 to this dispatcher, otherwise the dispatcher will attempt to resend the application at exponential intervals.

        Once a Funding Application is received this endpoint allows a failure or rejection to be provided in response.
        Failing an application allows the client to resubmit and should be used to report formatting, processing or data errors.
        Rejecting an application is terminal. A client cannot resubmit.
        The comment and reference are optional, but a reason must be provided.
        Fail an application
        ```json
        "reason": "Failed",
        "comment": "Unable to verify directors address. Please check and resubmit.",
        "reference": "y76fga78s"

        Reject an application
        ```json
        "reason": "Ineligible",
        "comment": "A directors credit checks did not pass our requirements",
