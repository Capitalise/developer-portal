# Launch Checklist

Below is a list of recommended steps to take before launching your Capitalise integration in production. While they might not all be required for the minimal operation of your application, the steps below will help to make your Capitalise integration more robust, secure, efficient, and maintainable.

- Ensure that your impelemtaton functions properly when user only enter the minimum viable data (those required by the API). Appropriate valiation should be clear for the user.
- We will collabratively check with you on:
  - If a funding search is successfully submitted to us. You can check this in the [Cases](https://demo.capitalise.com/app/ui/cases?filters=%7B%22cases%22%3A%22active%22%7D&search=) tab using the Demo account to login.
  - If the submitted data is in the right format

- If you are pre-selecting the top four lenders then it's best practice to inform customers.
- Do not mislead the user and suggest the lenders will review the application directly. Make it clear that Capitlsie provides a free review service and may contact them directly to discuss the application before sharing with lenders.

You need to be clear youâ€™re passing the client over to Capitalise and how weâ€™ll use and manage that data.

## Branding Guidelines

When using Capitalise logos, name or imagery in your platform you should always follow these branding guidelines.

### Mentioning Capitaise

When you mention Capitalise in text, you should use capitalise.com when not using a hyperlink, or mention [Capitalise](https://capitalise.com/) with a hyperlink as in this example.

### Mentioning Funding

When you mention funding and the selection process you should:

- Do not use the term 'deals' or 'funding option' or 'Funding Options'
  - Instead use the terms 'funding matches', 'funding results'
- Use the term 'Submit' or 'Submit to Capitalise' instead of 'Apply'
  - Creating a new funding search does not automatically apply to those selected lenders
  - Be clear data is being sent to Capitalise for review, before being released to lenders

### Approved Logos

Please use these approved Capitalise logos.
